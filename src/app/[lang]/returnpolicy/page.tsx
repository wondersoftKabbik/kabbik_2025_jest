          Our return policy allows active kabbik members to take a chance on a new narrator or story without losing a credit, or return titles purchased in error. Returns must be made within 365 days of purchase. Our ability to offer this policy is dependent on our members using it only for these purposes. We reserve the right to monitor returns for any abuse, such as excessive returns, frequent return of titles after prolonged listening, or returns of multiple titles at a time. In instances where we find return privileges are being misused, Kabbik reserves the right in its sole discretion to limit the number of returns allowed by each member, including, but not limited to, the loss of return privileges. Customers who cancel or fail to maintain their membership in good standing are not eligible to make returns. Kabbik may cancel or modify the terms of our returns policy with respect to any or all participants at any time.
